# Gyrom GuessTheNumberGame

this is my 1st try at a guess the number game. tried to make it 'unbreakable' - hope it worked.

simply put, the app picks a random number between 1 and 20, then asks the user to input a number.
it doesnt allow the user to enter a non string input, and it doesnt allow entering a number outside the range.
the program gives the user 5 turns, and notifies him every time he loses a turn.

then, if the user hits the correct number, it ends the game. same goes if he inputs 5 wrong number.
